The *Save* button is located at the bottom of the Engagement Details page. Once you have entered the minimum information to create an engagement (Superuser only - Engagement Name and Engagement Dates), you can save the engagement.

Any Superusers and team members assigned to this Engagement can now add/edit content and save at any time by clicking the *Save* button at the bottom of the page.

Please note: clicking the *Preview* button also saves all the new/edited content on the page.
