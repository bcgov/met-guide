After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. 

- To add a widget to your engagement, click the *Add Widget* button on the top right corner of the Engagement Detail page. 

- You can add one, or many widgets to an engagement.  

- You can edit the display name of each widget. e.g. the Video widget could be renamed to “Overview of the project”.

![Widgets](/assets/UserGuideImages/Images/widgets/widgets-engagement-details-page-highlighting-the-add-widget-section.png){: .light .shadow .rounded-10}

You can view the list of all the widgets available on the [Widgets page](/met-guide/posts/widgets/)
