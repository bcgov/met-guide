Administrators can edit *Hidden*, *Ready* and *Linked* surveys as long as the engagement they are linked to is not yet scheduled or published. Team Members can edit a survey attached to an engagement they are assigned to as long as the engagement it is linked to is not yet scheduled or published. Surveys that have been scheduled/published can no longer be edited. 

After creating and saving a survey, you can edit it from the [Survey Listing](/met-guide/posts/survey-listing/) page or directly from the engagement it is attached to.

From the Survey Listing page, find the survey you wish to edit. To edit the survey, you can either:

- Click *Edit Survey* from the action drop-down

- Click on the survey name then click on *Edit Survey* from the Preview Survey header
