The **Map Widget** allows you to add the project's location on a map.

After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. For more information on widgets in general, please go to the [Widgets' page](/met-guide/posts/widgets/).

After selecting **Map**, you can either:
- Upload a Shapefile: A shapefile will show where the project spans geographically. This will store the location, shape, and attributes of the project's features, and auto-calculate the latitude and longitude.
- Input Lat/Long Coordinates: Inputting the latitude and longitude will drop a pin on the specific geographic point.

You can preview the map's display through the *Preview Map* button on the bottom right.
