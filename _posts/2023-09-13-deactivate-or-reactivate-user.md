As a Superuser, you can Deactivate and Reactivate users in the application.  

From the [User Details](/met-guide/posts/user-details/) page, there will be a *Deactivate* or *Reactivate* button (depending on the users status) on the top right of the screen.

Deactivating a user will remove all their accesses to the application. They will no longer have login ability and their status on previously active engagements will be set to 'Deactivated'.  

Reactivating a user will regain their access to the system as their last role upon deactivation. *In other words, if someone was deactivated as a Team Member, they will be automatically reactivated as a Team Member.*  

If the user is reactivated as a Team Member or Reviewer, you will have to manually add them back to engagements. They will not be automatically readded to their previous engagements.
