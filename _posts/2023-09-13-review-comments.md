As an Administrator, you can review all comments on all engagements. As a Team Member, you can review comments on the engagement(s) you are assigned to. 

You can see if there are any new comments requiring review on the Engagement Listing or Survey Listing page. The number of new comments will show on the "new" comment badge as a number representing the number of comments to be reviewed.

Click the badge to access the new comments. You will see a list of all the new comments on the Comment Listing page. After clicking on a Comment ID from the Comment Listing page, you will be directed to the Comment Review page. There will be the option to approve, reject, or require that a comment needs further review. If a comment is approved, it will be published in the public record (as long as the report includes it). 

To learn more about the comment review process, visit the [Comment Review](/met-guide/posts/comment-review-page/) page.
