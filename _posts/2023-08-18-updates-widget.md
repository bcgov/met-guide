The **Sign Up for Updates Widget** allows users to either sign up to an email list or sign up through a pre-defined form.

After an Administrator creates an engagement, Administrators and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. For more information on widgets, please go to [Widgets' page](/met-guide/posts/widgets/).

After selecting **Sign Up for Updates**, you can either select:
  
- Email List: A way for participants to voluntarily sign up to get automated updates on a project or every engagement on the platform through email. Emails will be sent when an engagement opens and two days (at 9am) before the engagement closes.

- Form Sign-up: A way for participants to voluntarily sign up for other updates, groups, committees, panels, etc.

The Email List description and call to action are customizable.  
The Form Sign-up will include predefined forms, but the call to action will remain customizable.  
  
This is an example of the Sign Up for Updates Widget on the page as the public will see it.
