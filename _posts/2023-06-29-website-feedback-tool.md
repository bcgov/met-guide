Internal or external users can click the **Website Feedback** blue tab on the lower right side of the screen to submit their feedback on the Modern Engagement Tools application with an emoticon and report an issue or share an idea (optional). A textbox will appear which allows for an explanation of their selected feedback type.

After clicking **Website Feedback** on the left side panel, you will see the Feedback Tool page where there is a listing of user feedback on the application.  

This page will show the feedback emoticon, date published, source, feedback type, feedback message, and an action column.   

The "Actions" column has an action drop-down for each entry which allows you to archive or delete feedback. Any feedback containing personal information must be deleted.
