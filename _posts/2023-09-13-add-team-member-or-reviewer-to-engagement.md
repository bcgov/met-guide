As an Administrator or Team Member, you can assign Team Members and Reviewers to engagements. 

- An Administrator can assign **any** Team Member/Reviewer to **any** engagement. 
- A Team Member can assign **any** Team Member/Reviewer to engagements that they are already assigned to.

There are two places where assigning a Team Member/Reviewer to an engagement can occur:

- From the [User Management](/met-guide/posts/user-management/) page (Team Members and Reviewers)
  
    ![UM drop down](/assets/UserGuideImages/Images/add-team-member-or-reviewer-to-engagement/add-team-member-or-reviewer-to-engagement-image-of-user-management-page-with-action-drop-down-for-assign-to-engagement.png){: .light .w-75 .shadow .rounded-10 w='1212' h='668'}

  After selecting *Assign to an Engagement* from the Action drop-down, you will see a pop-up to search for the engagement you would like to assign this user to. You must at least type the first 3 letters of the engagement's name in order for options to populate. After clicking the *Submit* button, this user will be successfully assigned to the engagement which you can validate on the [User Details](/met-guide/posts/user-details/) page. 
  
- From the [Engagement User Management](/met-guide/posts/engagement-UM/) tab (Team Members only)
  
    ![Eng UM drop down](/assets/UserGuideImages/Images/add-team-member-or-reviewer-to-engagement/add-team-member-or-reviewer-to-engagement-image-of-engagement-um-tab-with-add-tm-circled.png){: .light .w-75 .shadow .rounded-10 w='1212' h='668'}

  After clicking the *+ Add Team Member* button, you will see a pop-up to search for the Team Member you would like to assign to this engagement. You must at least type the first 3 letters of the Team Member's name in order for options to populate. After clicking the *Submit* button, this Team Member will be successfully assigned to the engagement.
