As a Superuser, you can edit an engagement at any time. As a Team Member, you can only edit an engagement before it is scheduled/published. 

To edit an existing engagement, click Engagement on the left-side menu to go to the Engagement Listing page. Locate the engagement you want to edit and select *Edit Engagement* in the Actions drop-down. You will land on the [Engagement Details](/met-guide/posts/engagement-details/) page where you can edit your engagement.

Alternatively, you can edit your engagement from the [Preview Engagement](/met-guide/posts/preview-engagement/)  page by clicking the *Edit Engagement* button in the yellow banner on the top of the page.
