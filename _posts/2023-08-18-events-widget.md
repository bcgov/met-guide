The **Events Widget** allows you to add the details of an in-person or virtual event happening for an engagement.

After a Superuser creates an engagement, Superusers and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. For more information on widgets, please go to [Widgets' page](/met-guide/posts/widgets/).

After selecting **Events**, you can either add an in-person event or a virtual session. There is no limit to the number of combinations of events added to the engagement.  

- In-Person Event: An in-person event can include a description, the name of the event's location, the event's address, the date of the event, and the time of the event.

- Virtual Session: A virtual event/session can include a description, the date of the session, the time of the session, a link to the session (or registration form), and let you edit the link into a call-to-action (for example, Click here to register).
