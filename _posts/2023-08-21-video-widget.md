The **Video Widget** allows you to add a video link to your engagement.

After an Administrator creates an engagement, Administrators and Team Members can add widgets to display on the engagement page. For more information on widgets in general, please go to the [Widgets' page](/met-guide/posts/widgets/).

After selecting **Video**, you can add a description and insert the video link. Please note that the video must be hosted on one of the compatible platforms: YouTube or Vimeo.  

This is an example of the Video Widget on the page as the public will see it.
