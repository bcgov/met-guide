Users can log in to the application with their IDIR credentials which will direct them to an "Access Requested" screen. Administrators will see their name appear in the [User Management](/met-guide/posts/user-management/) tab where they can then assign them a role by selecting *Assign Role* from the action drop-down.  

An Administrator can also reassign a role to a user by selecting *Reassign Role* from the Actions drop-down on the User Management page.
